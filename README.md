Introduction

The concept of the Single Page Application (SPA) has emerged over the past few years - sometimes you use it without even knowing it. A lot of the websites you visit frequently use the concept ... Office365, Gmail, Facebook and the Management console for Azure are a few that come to mind. The main change from the traditional mode of posting everything back to the server for page refreshes and new content, is that the single page application keeps the user 'on the same page', and aims to only swap out the interactive parts of the 'application' that change during the life cycle of the page. In the old regime, we didn't really have to worry too much about memory in the browser - I mean why would we? .. the user spent a very short time on each page before it was completely refreshed with a postback to the server which processed the data sent in and then served up a new fresh page to the user. #WhatMemoryLeak ?
